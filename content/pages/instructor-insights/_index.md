Course Overview
---------------

This page focuses on the 8-lecture course _D4M Signal Processing on Databases_ as it was taught by Dr. Jeremy Kepner in Fall 2012.

Search, social media, ad placement, mapping, tracking, spam filtering, fraud detection, wireless communication, drug discovery, and bioinformatics all attempt to find items of interest in vast quantities of data. This course teaches a signal processing approach to these problems by combining linear algebraic graph algorithms, group theory, and database design. The class begins with a number of practical problems, offers an introduction to the appropriate theory, and then demonstrates how to apply the theory to the aforementioned problems. Students apply these ideas in a final project of their choosing. The course contains a number of smaller assignments which provide students with appropriate software infrastructure for completing their final projects.

Course Outcomes
---------------

### Course Goals for Students

*   Gain an awareness of [D4M: Dynamic Distributed Dimensional Data Model](http://www.mit.edu/~kepner/D4M/), a breakthrough in computer programming that combines the advantages of five distinct processing technologies to provide a database and computation system that addresses the problems associated with Big Data
*   Become facile with D4M, such that participants can begin applying it to their own problems
*   Understand the new mathematical concepts that have emerged as a result of bringing together signal processing and Big Data concepts
